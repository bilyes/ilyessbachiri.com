Introduction:
  Bio: |
    I'm a software engineer with a passion for open source. I love solving complex problems,
    and building things from the ground up. I also like to contribute to and support open
    source projects and build some of my own. I'm always striving to expand my knowledge
    in a multitude of subjects ranging from software and hardware technologies to science.
