    Summary: |
      As part of my research, I looked into the problem of combinatorial optimization,
      especially combined with a powerful node ordering heuristic. The use case of my
      applied research was the problem of the scheduling of wood planning. My work
      leveraged machine learning to explore the space of solutions and detect areas
      where the optimal solution is likely to be encountered. The result of my research
      was a reinforcement learning based algorithm that solves wood planning scheduling
      problems considerably faster than the state of the art approach. For more details,

    Summary: |
      I spent the last year of my bachelor program in computer science as an exchange
      student in Université Laval. There, I got the chance to enroll in a variety of
      interesting undergraduate as well as graduate level classes. The one that stood
      out the most is by far "Introduction to Robotics" where I got to build a microcontroller
      chip, mount it on top of a Roomba-like robot and program it to track and 
      follow an object using infra-red and camera sensors.

    Summary: |
      During my bachelor program I learned the fundamentals of computer science,
      from low level concepts around electronics and networking to high level courses
      like algorithms and software engineering and some theoretical subjects
      in between like state machines, compilation, and game theory.
